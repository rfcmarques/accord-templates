# accord-templates
This is a repository for templates made by me where I develop solutions for my master's degree thesis project where I have to create an engine for creating smart legal contracts.

Each folder is a diferent example that will serve a different use case, everything will be specified in the README documents of each example.

All of the examples are based in the Accord Project and it's technology.

This work shall not be replicated.
